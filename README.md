# ClientInventory
Simple dockerized dotnet core 2 microservice using mongodb as data store.
The main goal here is to exercise the use of linked containers.

There is no TDD implementation currently, however, we might slowly evolve this repo to follow the best practices for OO programming.

# Frameworks used
- .NET Core 2
- MongoDB Driver and container
- Docker
